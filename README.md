# The DMV

## Overview
This is solo project #2 for Mod1 of Turing's Back end program.

Three main goals of the project:

1. Work with an existing code base and debug any issues from previous developers
2. expand upon the code base to provide more functionality within the program
3. Work with external APIs to retrieve data; creating new objects and reformating API data

Tech Stack: 

- Ruby - gems: Faraday
- RSpec

Testing:

All methods are unit and intergration tested with the exception of the vehicle_factory class. This was ommited purposefully as objects can be viewed in the DMV washington API and pulling individual objects within the test would have made the test suite messy. 

Summary of skills learned or expanded: 

- debugging existing codebase - properly reading and tracing errors with utilization of pry and RSpec
- expanding on previous method building skills - namely working with hashes as form of data
- working with APIs - reading external data, creating new objects with external data, reformatting external data
